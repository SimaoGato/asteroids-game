# Asteroids Game

This is a straightforward implementation of the classic Asteroids arcade game. The essence of Asteroids is simple: players control a spaceship in a debris-filled universe, tasked with shooting and destroying asteroids that drift across the screen. When asteroids are shot, they break into smaller pieces, making the challenge grow. The primary goal is to survive as long as possible by avoiding collisions with the fragmented asteroids.

This project was developed using **Pygame**, a popular library for making games in Python, as part of a guided learning experience from [boot.dev](https://boot.dev).
